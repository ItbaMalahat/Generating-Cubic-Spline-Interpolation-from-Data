Cubic Spline Interpolation

Introduction
- This project implements cubic spline interpolation to approximate a smooth curve that passes through a given set of data points. Cubic spline interpolation is a method used in numerical analysis and numerical mathematics to construct interpolating functions. It is particularly useful when dealing with data that may not follow a simple linear or polynomial relationship.

Features
- Data Import: Reads data points from a text file.
- Interpolation: Generates cubic spline interpolation for the given data points.
- Visualization: Displays the resulting cubic spline interpolation curve.

Requirements
- MATLAB

Usage
- Place your data points in a text file named data.txt. Each line should contain two numbers separated by a space, representing x and y coordinates respectively.
- Run the MATLAB script cubic_spline_interpolation.m.
- The script will import the data from data.txt, perform cubic spline interpolation, and display the resulting curve.
